## About Tölvera

Tölvera is a Python library for composing together and interacting with self-organising systems and artificial life. 
It provides creative coding-style APIs that allow users to combine and compose various built-in behaviours, such as flocking, slime mold growth, and swarming, and also author their own. 
With built-in support for Open Sound Control (OSC) and interactive machine learning (IML), Tölvera interfaces with and rapidly maps onto existing music software and hardware, striving to be both an accessible and powerful tool for exploring diverse intelligence in artistic contexts.

Tölvera is developed by [Dr. Jack Armitage](http://jackarmitage.com) and was originally created  at the [Intelligent Instruments Lab](http://iil.is), University of Iceland.
In 2024, Tölvera was awarded a grant from [Mozilla Builders](https://builders.mozilla.org/project/tolvera/).
This excerpt from an opinion piece for Mozilla outlines the motivation behind Tölvera:

!!! quote
    Picture the space of all possible forms of intelligence. Now zoom in — way in — until you see a tiny mote. That’s where we’re stuck right now: trapped in the speck of machine learning and large language models.

    While these tools are impressive, they represent just a fraction of this possibility space. AI discourse risks becoming a closed loop, with concerns about ML’s impact met only with proposals for better ML models, reinforcing our fixation. How do we build outward to see and benefit from intelligence in all its wonderfully diverse embodiments?
